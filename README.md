# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Info
This is a simple "rock, paper, scissors" program written in Python. It uses the `random` module to randomize computer responses, with the code in a `while` loop so that you can play as long as you would like to.

This project is my first project since switching from Neovim to VS Code. I'm trying to get used to the VS Code keybinds *and* improve my coding skills, and I felt doing projects was the best way to do so.
